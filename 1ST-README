Warning!!!!!!

BACKUP!BACKUP!
I can't say it enough times.  If you try to install these updated libs on
your system, and it breaks so many programs that you can't fix 'em all,
and you don't have backup......

Installing lib-glow-standard as is on an existing server (e.g. one with
programs already installed), will potentially break other programs until
they're upgraded to use lib-glow-standard (usually as simple as adding
$include $lib/glowstandard, but not always).  If you want to install
lib-glow-standard one a already up and running...BACKUP.  Just to be sure,
make two backups, or three!

Any other programs should install okay.  Make sure no one has made local
modifications to a program you're upgrading.  Ideally, there shouldn't be
(bad practice...doesn't allow for upgrades).  If you are thinking of making
a modification to one of the programs below, feel free to send me your changes
and I will incorporate them into the next release.

Did I mention you should backup your stuff?
