Warning!!!!!!

BACKUP!BACKUP!
I can't say it enough times.  If you try to install these updated libs on
your system, and it breaks so many programs that you can't fix 'em all,
and you don't have backup......

Installing lib-glow-standard as is on an existing server (e.g. one with
programs already installed), will potentially break other programs until
they're upgraded to use lib-glow-standard (usually as simple as adding
$include $lib/glowstandard, but not always).  If you want to install
lib-glow-standard one a already up and running, lots of programs already
installed system, try using lib-glow-standard-existing instead.

Any other programs should install okay (be careful not to mess up any local
modifications, if any).  If they do, feel free to let me know.
