---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glow Distribution of "Standard" Programs
-----------
I. How to install a MUF program to the muck
-------------------------------------------
  A. Overview
    In general, you have to connect to the muck, and transmit the contents of
    the muf source file to the muck. All the source files in this package
    assume the following:
    1. That the player installing them is a Wizard (typically #1).
    2. That the player installing them is currently located in #0, or the
       "top level" environment/parent room.
  B. Specific Client Example: TinyFugue
     Tinyfugue makes this process particularly easy.  Simply type:
     /quote -S 'path-to-source-file to install a given file.  For example:
     /quote -S '~/cmd-register would install cmd-register.
  C. Specific Client Example: SimpleMU
     In most cases, you can open the file in a text editor (such as notepad)
     and highlight the _entire_ file and use the classic windows copy-and-paste
     method.
  D. Specific Client Example: zMUD
     1. Connect to the muck.
     2. Click on "Actions"
     3. Click on "Send To Mud"
     4. Click on the folder icon to browse to the file. You'll need to change
        the "Files of Type" to "All Files"
     5. Make sure "String to prefix" and "String to postfix are empty.
     6. Click on "Send"

II. Core Library Install
------------------------
The following have to be installed FIRST (before all other programs/libs) in
this order:

cmd-register
lib-glow-standard
lib-strings
lib-stackrng
lib-lmgr
lib-safe-call
lib-edit
lib-editor
lib-match
lib-mesg
lib-mesgbox
lib-case
lib-unparseobj
lib-look
lib-reflist
lib-index
lib-mpi
lib-connects
lib-showlist
cmd-mv-cp
lib-userprop
lib-wordwrap
lib-write

III. cmd-path (deprecated)
------------
(Not recommended, but provided if you want to)
At this point, if you're going to install cmd-path, you should do so now.
Then you can install the rest of the programs as you wish.  
  A. Install the cmd-path muf.
  B. Use @@tune path_prog=<dbref of path prog>
  C. Use wpsetup to set the path dir. If you're using the standard dir (which
     I strongly advise) use wpsetup cmd-path=d. If not, use wpsetup as
     appropiate and update the @@tune path_dir appropiately.

IV. Comments about specific programs
------------------------------------
  Mainly notes on problem areas

  cmd-path:
    This program requires lib-userprop.

  cmd-page:
    This program requires lib-userprop.  You'll also need to use the wpsetup
    command to setup a userpropdir for it (wpsetup add cmd-page=p).  Don't
    forget to use page #setup.

  cmd-laston:
    This program has a dependency on cmd-page. I recommend installing cmd-page
    first.

  cmd-cinfo:
    This program requires you have cmd-find and cmd-laston installed to
    function properly.

  cmd-emotion:
    The @@action for it was starting to be a nuisance, besides, some of you
    may not want the default set of emotion/global/socials, so the action
    and it's props are stored separately in 'cmd-emotion-exit'.  Note that
    it is at least useful in seeing what props are set by -setup new.
    DO NOT EDIT THE FILE 'CMD-EMOTION-EXIT' WITH PICO!!!!!! You will mess
    up the @@action line, since pico will try to wrap the long line.

  cmd-compass:
    This program requires that you install a current version of cmd-path to
    function correctly.

  con-bbsindex:
    Requires /_bbs/boardname:boardroomref to be set on #0 to function properly.

  cmd-bbs:
    This program requires that you have con-bbsindex installed to function
    correctly.

  cmd-enterdesc:
    This program requires cmd-lsedit.

  cmd-watch/con-watch: 
    These programs need to be installed together.

  cmd-tell:
    You need cmd-page installed beofre this program will work.

  cmd-pcreate:
  cmd-mufrestart:
    On GlowMuck 3.0.1, this program needs to be 'owned' by a w3/w4 and
    cannot be owned by #1 (The Man).  Both of thes use the force prim,
    and #1 cannot be forced.

  cmd-archive:
    Can't be used by #1 to archive programs on glowmuck 3.0.1+.  cmd-archive
    uses the force prim to @@list programs, and #1 cannot be forced.

  cmd-conhistory:
    Requires a current version of cmd-page to be installed.

  cmd-roomcheck:
    Renamed @@check.  @@check is a in-server command revealing who controls
    an database item. If you prefer to have @@check=@@roomcheck, @@permissions
    will do the same as the inserver @@check.  Requires lib-match and lib-path

  cmd-notify:
    Requires con-caller to function.

  con-guest:
    If you're not using con-caller, don't forget to set a ~connect prop
    for this program.  You will also need to set the GS string in the program
    to whatever names you want for your guests.  Then create the guest
    characters named xxx_Guest using all but one of the names you've chosen.
    Then create a 'Guest' (no name_) character.  Set all of these characters
    'G' and set their /@@/id prop to 'Guest'.  All done.

  con-caller (con all connect):
    There is a section of code commented out.  This section is used on
    legacy to make sure folks have read all the new user and policy info.
    Since most mucks don't have the room that this uses, I commented it
    out by default.  Keep in mind this program calls several others,
    I'd look it over before using it, and see if you actually need it.
    Programs it will need to be installed: con-guest, cmd-announce, cmd-page,
    and con-watch.  It will be more useful if cmd-notify is installed also.

  cmd-parclean:
    You will need to register your parent of all parents using @@register as
    par/par (@@reg <dbref>=par/par) and register a parent to drop things into
    as par/misc (@@reg <dbref>=par/misc).  Cleans up parents and drops extras
    in $par/misc.

  cmd-morph:
    For now, cmd-morph relies on macro-longdesc to handle lsedit lists.

The only one of these libraries or muf-programs I "wrote" is the
lib-glow-standard one (which is mostly just a cut n' paste of the macros that
are commonly used in the muf programs). All others are either taken from the
glowmuf distribution or the fbmuf distribution. I'm leaving any existing
credits/author/copyright information intact as well as adding any that I may
discover or find out later on.

Okay, I added cmd-ic-ooc, a quick hack to utilize the ic-in-who code.

And much later, added lib-unparseobj, a fancier, colorful, unparseobj, inspired
by a similar library written by Syvel.

	Be sure to @@tune path_prog=<dbref of path prog> after installing
cmd-path.
	NOTE: These installation scripts assume that the player installing
the programs is a Wizard.  They also assume that any global actions made
are to be made in the room that Wizard is standing in.  So If you want all
your global actions to be stored in a specific room, be sure to
be in that room when quoting them.
	To install a program or library, simply quote it to the Glow server,
using tinyfugue's /quote feature, or something equivalent.
