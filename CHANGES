01) lib-stackrng: Added entries so that you can use SRNGxxx (instead of sr-xxx)
                  to make calls to the public functions in lib-stackrng. Fixed
                  a series of logic flaws in SRNGfilterng that caused it to not
                  work at all. Fixed bugs in SRNGswaprng, it now works as
                  advertised.
02) lib-edit:     Made the .format and right-justify commands work correctly
                  with text that has color codes in it.
03) cmd-bbs:      Added color (thanks to Wixenstyx!) and applied bugfixes
                  discovered by Wixenstyx.
                  Replaced call to EDITdisplay to EDITansi_display so you can
                  use color in the body text of your messages.
                  Added customization features that allow you to change where
                  the data is stored and also, if needed, change the output to
                  reflect any changes you make to the command names.
                  (see the program text for details). This also required some
                  minor changes to con-bbsindex.

2004 February 27: FM 1.00
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
01) cmd-teleport: Added the anti-crossworld teleport feature to cmd-teleport
                  Adjusted to handle properly the customizable props for
                  cmd-find.
02) lib-editor: Added the .sort option to the list editor (in lib-editor)
                and colorized responses. Added the .al and .ap commands,
                essentially to display the colorized versions of the text.
03) lib-edit: Added EDITansi_list and EDITansi_display library functions,
              Revised format, left justify and right justify to handle ansi
              correctly.
04) cmd-lsedit: Colorized responses, it also inherits the changes to lib-edit
                and lib-editor. Added the lsmove, lscopy and lsdelete commands
05) cmd-path: Added backlink feature: Allows user to make the 'reverse' path
              when making a path (e.g. north and south, west and east, etc.)
06) cmd-emotion: Started adding 'far' features to cmd-emotion
07) Added support for look programs that don't properly put "(@desc)" on the
    stack when calling a program.  Uncommenting the $define STUPIDLOOK 1 will
    turn this support on.
08) lib-strings: Added support to (STRfillfield, STRleft, STRright, STRcenter)
                 to allow them to parse strings with ^COLOR^ codes in them
                 correctly. Credit goes to Syvel for the original correction
                 concept.
09) cmd-3who: now supports the /@/dark prop.
10) cmd-find: now has more customizability in regard to what props it uses,
              as well as the list headings.  It also now supports the /@/dark
              prop, configurably.
11) cmd-mv-cp: Fixed a flaw in cmd-mv-cp where it could no longer be used as a
               library.
12) cmd-register: Using a '$' in cmd-register names now fails, so you don't
    end up with reg entries of $foo: foo.muf...
13) cmd-roomcheck: fixed bug in the installer.
14) cmd-who: fixed bug in cmd-who where ALL players were listed in the
    "elsewhere in the game" string.  Added support for /@/dark.
15) lib-glow: noguest uses FAIL instead of RED now.
16) lib-stackrng: Had a conflicting definition of popn.

2000 December 22: Beta Release 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fixed issue with cmd-bbs not dealing with custom look programs properly,
   and updated documentation accordingly.
2) Fixed cmd-vote's wiz access to changing votes
3) In theory, the rcs-ifying and compatibility w/ lib-glow pass is now
   complete.

2000 January 27: Alpha Release 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Documentation and fixes for cmd-setworld, cmd-teleport, and cmd-roomcheck
   Minor updates on several others.

2000 January 17: Alpha Release 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) All goals same as before.  Version of FB muf that we're now current with
   is FB5.66...which had no apparent changes from FB5.64. Still have about
   half the programs to checkover for other minor fixes (documentation, 
   version numbers, etc.

1999 April 18: Alpha Release 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary goals for final release:
1) Update all programs to any improvements in the FB5.64 versions and any
   improvements in the GlowMuck 3.1.0 versions.
2) Finish completing the changes outlined in the 1June1998 entry of this
   document.

New Items:

cmd-cyberspace
cmd-conhistory
cmd-roomcheck
cmd-wwwlist

1998 June 1: Alpha Release of this distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Base: Glowmuf 1.9.3 Release and FuzzBall MUF 5.61 Release

With this initial release I have four objectives in mind:
1) Change all the libs and muf programs so that they do not use macros but
   use a new library called lib-glow-standard (registered as lib/glowstandard)
2) Update the programs with any bugfixes or improvements included in the
   FuzzBall Distribution (FB5.60) of MUF programs.
3) Update the programs for compatibility with GlowMuck 3.0.1
4) Assign a version number to each program and library so in future releases,
   we can tell which libraries or programs need updated.  Any program or
   library that makes no mention of a version number will get assigned
   FM1.0 as the version number.  If the program already has a version
   number the FM1.0 will be appended to that version number. This way
   a quick glance at @reg will tell you which programs are out of date.
   (In case you're curious, I'm simply using my initials, seemed an easy way
   to differentiate between FB's dist, Andy's dist for glow, and my dist for
   glow).
Other 'Across the board' changes:
5) Many of the libs/programs had more complete documentation as a comment in
   the FB5.61 version of them.  I've included this documentation.  In addition,
   I've set the @desc of the libraries to tell you what lines to list to see
   that documentation.
6) I've adjusted the scripts so that at the beginning and end there is a 'say'
   that tells you it's beginning or ending the installation, and what it's
   installing.  I have had problems in the past with seeing when the 
   installation is done, or if that 'pause' is just a some big huge lag. 

Programs originally written for glow MUF 1.9.3 or earlier, MUF FB5.61 or
earlier, or the original TinyMuck (any version), may or may not work 'as is'
if you're this distribution of libs.  At a minimum, any program using a
'standard macro' will require a $include $lib/glowstandard line towards the
beginning of the program. (I generally try to put the line with any other
$includes...). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cmd-register:
  I had to reincorporate the support for _version and _lib-version. Apparently,
  at some point it was removed from cmd-register.  Replaced calls to macros
  .strcheck, .noguest/guest? and sls/sts with the actual muf code they
  contained.  cmd-register is a special case, in that it can't make calls to
  libraries in it's definition, since it's installed before any libraries
  exist.  Bear this in mind when you decide to change library functions such
  as .tell changes to any library functions will NOT affect cmd-register.

lib-glow-standard:
  This file is new in this release.  It includes the macros contained in
  macro-macro, std-defs, def-pmatch, lib-props.  Be warned that almost all of
  the functions are prefixed by a period (e.g. .tell) prevent any potential
  conflicts with local words/functions.  The only exceptions are: for, endfor,
  xor.

lib-stackrng:
  Removed the redundant popoffn function (it was indentical in function as the
  inserver 'popn'.  Made sure that sr-deleterng and sr-poprng functions were
  changed appropiately.

cmd-mv-cp:
  Oops.  It was registering as cmd/mv-cp, but the lib defs props
  that were being set were using $global/mv-cp.  Minor bug there.
  I changed it so it is being registered as lib/mv-cp and cmd/mv-cp,
  changed lib defs to use $lib/mv-cp.

macro-macro:
  This file no longer exists.  All the macros from it have been moved to
  the $lib/glowstandard (lib-glow-standard).

macro-showlist:
  This file was converted to be used as $lib/showlist, and the file-name
  change to lib-showlist.  reg_names and file names should reflect function!

cmd-archive:
  Added the fb feature =p.  Fixed a bug where @archiv'ing #0 resulted in a error.

cmd-ic-ooc:
  New in this release.  A quick and dirty for setting the in_character flag for
  players.  defaults to ic=in character, ooc=out of character.

cmd-page:
  For 'idle status' it now uses the "idletime" sysparm instead of an arbitrary
  value and the help screens are cleaned up. (Thank you, Maddax).

con-caller:
  Commented out the ~accept checking, this is only used on Legacy.

cmd-ic-ooc:
  New in this distribution.  Sets/unsets the in_character flag. (with fancy message)

lock-guest:
  Removed.  Not needed for glow, make sure your guests are set G, and set the
exits you don't want guests to use G.

lock-prop:
  Removed. Use @lock obj=prop:val instead.  It checks the player, and/or any
objs in the player's possession.
