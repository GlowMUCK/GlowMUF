I try to keep all the changes on a by program basis, so that you can install
the individual programs to keep up-to-date. I don't always succeed in getting
all the changes in, so it is wise to check the CVS repository for each program
and their current versions, or check the version number in the individual files
and compare it to the version shown by @register.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2007 April 19: FM 1.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
00) Most Programs:Various updates to documentation and installation scripts.
                  General reduction of dependency on lib-glow-standard
01) cmd-page:     Replaced the built-in editor with appropiate calls to
                  lib-editor. Revised front end so p #mail <name> <name>...
                  worked correctly. Added back in the #changes support and the
                  "page has upgraded warning. Fixed issue which would cause
                  page to bomb with empty messages. Added support so that
                  wizards can control whether guests can page, and who.
02) lib-editor,   Using period without any other text after it, or using period
    lib-edit,     and a space no longer results in the program failing. Fixed
    cmd-lsedit    bug which let you get into the editor prematurely.
                  Fixed various bugs in the display commands. Added ability to
                  run MUF programs from within the editor.
03) cmd-ansi      Updated to use 256 color mode with notifications
04) cmd-archive   Fixed permission issues when archiving wizard owned items.
05) cmd-bbs       Character limit added for subject lines
06) cmd-find      Fixed bug where STR-split was called incorrectly. 
07) lib-glow-std  Remove .debug-xxx commands, there are now inserver versions
08) cmd-laston    Fixed error which would present negative last on times
09) cmd-mv-cp     Library words documented
10) cmd-who       Fixed issue which would cause problems if all people 
                  present were 'dozing/asleep'. Grammar errors fixed.
11) lib-look		  Fixed bug which caused lib-look to fail with certain contents
                  Added support for contents of containers
                  Fixed interpretive issues with sticky/silent flag
12) lib-stackrng  Added SRNG-uniquerng which produces a range of unique items
                  from the given range.
13) lib-strings   Added STR-command. Converts #help, -help, or /help to 'help'
                  Added STR-null? to check to see if a string is null.
                  Fixed STR-blank? so a string with ansi codes only was 
                  considered blank.
14) lib-wordwrap  Better error checking
15) look-show-exits Exits lister designed to be used with look's, ~look props
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2004 May 08: FM 1.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01) lib-edit,     Added a .color command that prepends the range of lines 
    lib-editor    given with the color specified, or replaces previously
    cmd-lsedit    prepended color with the new color.
                  Fixed .split and .format so that they correctly preserve
                  colorization. Added the .ruler command. Upgraded to more
                  easily handle @props.
            		  Fixed bug in EDITORarguement that would cause the editor
                  to crash after being passed certain combinations of invalid
            		  line references. 
02) cmd-roomcheck:Is now more intelligent about checking desc's when
                  @tune transparent_paths is turned on.
03) cmd-emotion:  Fixed issue where a custom look program will cause the
                  "look at description for list" feature to fail.
                  Added emotions/socials commands to list the emotions/socials.
04) lib-look:     Various changes to slowly bring it up to glow standards:
                  less dependency on macros and $lib/glow. Added MPI parsing
                  for relevant properties. Replaced notifies with ansi_notify
                  so that color is parsed appropiately. Changed to call
                  lib-unparseobj as appropiate to properly colorize or not
                  various strings (name, name(#1PW), etc.). Fixed issues with
                  certain flags generating the wrong output (C on players, in
                  particular), Added support for @detail/@object. Added library
                  calls to follow the 'standard' format for library calls.
                  Added additional library calls to the new @detail related
                  words. General documentation cleanup. Support for @idesc
                  added. Fixed 'me' & 'here'matching to work as you might
  		  					expect. FAIL messages now use ^FAIL^ to colorize.
								  Fixed colorization issues with LOOKshort-list*. WARNING!
								  This has a hidden side-effect. lib-reflist relies on this
								  public library word to generate a formatted list.  Any
				          program relying on lib-reflist may generate colorized strings
                  where they didn't before. Unfortunately, many of those same
                  programs do not use ansi_notify, which means instead of
                  seeing colored text, you see '^RED^Fred rides away' etc.
                  In particular, I've identified a popular 'ride' and 'mumble'
                  programs that have this problem.  The solution is to replace
                  the notify's in those programs with ansi_notify's.
                  New Feature: ~look props. If a ~look/something:ref prop is
                  set anywhere in the environment, the program 'ref' will be
                  called by lib-look, with (Look) on top of the stack.
            		  New Feature: Made the standard filter public so that extended
            		  filters can be written without having to recreate the
            		  functionality of the standard filter yourself.
                  Added support for Wixenstyx's FENI library. If it exists on
                  the server, lib-look will use it.
05) cmd-teleport: Added define to allow customization of the format of the
                  location field.
06) cmd-who:      Changed to respect the who_hides_dark sysparm.
07) lib-stackrng: Fixed bug in SRNGswaprng which left trash on the stack.
08) lib-mesg:     More compatible with @propped messages (and lib-mesgbox)
09) lib-wordwrap: New library. Pass it a string and length, and it spits back
                  a string-range nicely word wrapped to that length.
10) lib-unparseobj: New library. Drop in replacement for unparseobj that has
                    fully customizable formatting and colorization.
11) cmd-page:     Added definitions for the public words so that they can be
                  called via library calls.
12) cmd-spoof:    Cleaned up semi-broken output that depended on a rather
                  clumsy loop to send the spoof to all the players in the room.
                  Replaced this with a corrected call to ansi_notify_except.
                  This fixes issues where puppets, zombies, vehicles, and
                  "listeners" didn't see spoofs.
13) cmd-register: Documentation update.
14) lib-glow-...: Fixed documentation for compatibility with the MUF editor's
            		  view command.

2004 March 14: FM 1.0.1 (1st sourceforge package)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01) lib-stackrng: Added entries so that you can use SRNGxxx (instead of sr-xxx)
                  to make calls to the public functions in lib-stackrng. Fixed
                  a series of logic flaws in SRNGfilterng that caused it to not
                  work at all. Fixed bugs in SRNGswaprng, it now works as
                  advertised.
02) lib-edit:     Made the .format and right-justify commands work correctly
                  with text that has color codes in it.
03) cmd-bbs:      Added color (thanks to Wixenstyx!) and applied bugfixes
                  discovered by Wixenstyx.
                  Replaced call to EDITdisplay to EDITansi_display so you can
                  use color in the body text of your messages.
                  Added customization features that allow you to change where
                  the data is stored and also, if needed, change the output to
                  reflect any changes you make to the command names.
                  (see the program text for details). This also required some
                  minor changes to con-bbsindex.

2004 February 27: FM 1.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
01) cmd-teleport: Added the anti-crossworld teleport feature to cmd-teleport
                  Adjusted to handle properly the customizable props for
                  cmd-find.
02) lib-editor: Added the .sort option to the list editor (in lib-editor)
                and colorized responses. Added the .al and .ap commands,
                essentially to display the colorized versions of the text.
03) lib-edit: Added EDITansi_list and EDITansi_display library functions,
              Revised format, left justify and right justify to handle ansi
              correctly.
04) cmd-lsedit: Colorized responses, it also inherits the changes to lib-edit
                and lib-editor. Added the lsmove, lscopy and lsdelete commands
05) cmd-path: Added backlink feature: Allows user to make the 'reverse' path
              when making a path (e.g. north and south, west and east, etc.)
06) cmd-emotion: Started adding 'far' features to cmd-emotion
07) Added support for look programs that don't properly put "(@desc)" on the
    stack when calling a program.  Uncommenting the $define STUPIDLOOK 1 will
    turn this support on.
08) lib-strings: Added support to (STRfillfield, STRleft, STRright, STRcenter)
                 to allow them to parse strings with ^COLOR^ codes in them
                 correctly. Credit goes to Syvel for the original correction
                 concept.
09) cmd-3who: now supports the /@/dark prop.
10) cmd-find: now has more customizability in regard to what props it uses,
              as well as the list headings.  It also now supports the /@/dark
              prop, configurably.
11) cmd-mv-cp: Fixed a flaw in cmd-mv-cp where it could no longer be used as a
               library.
12) cmd-register: Using a '$' in cmd-register names now fails, so you don't
    end up with reg entries of $foo: foo.muf...
13) cmd-roomcheck: fixed bug in the installer.
14) cmd-who: fixed bug in cmd-who where ALL players were listed in the
    "elsewhere in the game" string.  Added support for /@/dark.
15) lib-glow: noguest uses FAIL instead of RED now.
16) lib-stackrng: Had a conflicting definition of popn.

2000 December 22: Beta Release 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Fixed issue with cmd-bbs not dealing with custom look programs properly,
   and updated documentation accordingly.
2) Fixed cmd-vote's wiz access to changing votes
3) In theory, the rcs-ifying and compatibility w/ lib-glow pass is now
   complete.

2000 January 27: Alpha Release 4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Documentation and fixes for cmd-setworld, cmd-teleport, and cmd-roomcheck
   Minor updates on several others.

2000 January 17: Alpha Release 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) All goals same as before.  Version of FB muf that we're now current with
   is FB5.66...which had no apparent changes from FB5.64. Still have about
   half the programs to checkover for other minor fixes (documentation, 
   version numbers, etc.

1999 April 18: Alpha Release 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary goals for final release:
1) Update all programs to any improvements in the FB5.64 versions and any
   improvements in the GlowMuck 3.1.0 versions.
2) Finish completing the changes outlined in the 1June1998 entry of this
   document.

New Items:

cmd-cyberspace
cmd-conhistory
cmd-roomcheck
cmd-wwwlist

1998 June 1: Alpha Release of this distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Base: Glowmuf 1.9.3 Release and FuzzBall MUF 5.61 Release

With this initial release I have four objectives in mind:
1) Change all the libs and muf programs so that they do not use macros but
   use a new library called lib-glow-standard (registered as lib/glowstandard)
2) Update the programs with any bugfixes or improvements included in the
   FuzzBall Distribution (FB5.60) of MUF programs.
3) Update the programs for compatibility with GlowMuck 3.0.1
4) Assign a version number to each program and library so in future releases,
   we can tell which libraries or programs need updated.  Any program or
   library that makes no mention of a version number will get assigned
   FM1.0 as the version number.  If the program already has a version
   number the FM1.0 will be appended to that version number. This way
   a quick glance at @reg will tell you which programs are out of date.
   (In case you're curious, I'm simply using my initials, seemed an easy way
   to differentiate between FB's dist, Andy's dist for glow, and my dist for
   glow).
Other 'Across the board' changes:
5) Many of the libs/programs had more complete documentation as a comment in
   the FB5.61 version of them.  I've included this documentation.  In addition,
   I've set the @desc of the libraries to tell you what lines to list to see
   that documentation.
6) I've adjusted the scripts so that at the beginning and end there is a 'say'
   that tells you it's beginning or ending the installation, and what it's
   installing.  I have had problems in the past with seeing when the 
   installation is done, or if that 'pause' is just a some big huge lag. 

Programs originally written for glow MUF 1.9.3 or earlier, MUF FB5.61 or
earlier, or the original TinyMuck (any version), may or may not work 'as is'
if you are using this distribution of libs. At a minimum, any program using a
'standard macro' will require a $include $lib/glowstandard line towards the
beginning of the program. (I generally try to put the line with any other
$includes...). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cmd-register:
  I had to reincorporate the support for _version and _lib-version. Apparently,
  at some point it was removed from cmd-register.  Replaced calls to macros
  .strcheck, .noguest/guest? and sls/sts with the actual muf code they
  contained.  cmd-register is a special case, in that it can't make calls to
  libraries in it's definition, since it's installed before any libraries
  exist.  Bear this in mind when you decide to change library functions such
  as .tell changes to any library functions will NOT affect cmd-register.

lib-glow-standard:
  This file is new in this release.  It includes the macros contained in
  macro-macro, std-defs, def-pmatch, lib-props.  Be warned that almost all of
  the functions are prefixed by a period (e.g. .tell) prevent any potential
  conflicts with local words/functions.  The only exceptions are: for, endfor,
  xor.

lib-stackrng:
  Removed the redundant popoffn function (it was indentical in function as the
  inserver 'popn'.  Made sure that sr-deleterng and sr-poprng functions were
  changed appropiately.

cmd-mv-cp:
  Oops.  It was registering as cmd/mv-cp, but the lib defs props
  that were being set were using $global/mv-cp.  Minor bug there.
  I changed it so it is being registered as lib/mv-cp and cmd/mv-cp,
  changed lib defs to use $lib/mv-cp.

macro-macro:
  This file no longer exists.  All the macros from it have been moved to
  the $lib/glowstandard (lib-glow-standard).

macro-showlist:
  This file was converted to be used as $lib/showlist, and the file-name
  change to lib-showlist.  reg_names and file names should reflect function!

cmd-archive:
  Added the fb feature =p.  Fixed a bug where @archiv'ing #0 resulted in a error.

cmd-ic-ooc:
  New in this release.  A quick and dirty for setting the in_character flag for
  players.  defaults to ic=in character, ooc=out of character.

cmd-page:
  For 'idle status' it now uses the "idletime" sysparm instead of an arbitrary
  value and the help screens are cleaned up. (Thank you, Maddax).

con-caller:
  Commented out the ~accept checking, this is only used on Legacy.

cmd-ic-ooc:
  New in this distribution.  Sets/unsets the in_character flag. (with fancy message)

lock-guest:
  Removed.  Not needed for glow, make sure your guests are set G, and set the
exits you don't want guests to use G.

lock-prop:
  Removed. Use @lock obj=prop:val instead.  It checks the player, and/or any
objs in the player's possession.
