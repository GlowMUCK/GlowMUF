1 June 1998: Alpha Release of this distribution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Base: Glowmuf 1.9.3 Release and FuzzBall MUF 5.61 Release

With this initial release I have four objectives in mind:
1) Change all the libs and muf programs so that they do not use macros but
   use a new library called lib-glow-standard (registered as lib/glowstandard)
2) Update the programs with any bugfixes or improvements included in the
   FuzzBall Distribution (FB5.60) of MUF programs.
3) Update the programs for compatibility with GlowMuck 3.0.1
4) Assign a version number to each program and library so in future releases,
   we can tell which libraries or programs need updated.  Any program or
   library that makes no mention of a version number will get assigned
   FM1.0 as the version number.  If the program already has a version
   number the FM1.0 will be appended to that version number. This way
   a quick glance at @reg will tell you which programs are out of date.
   (In case you're curious, I'm simply using my initials, seemed an easy way
   to differentiate between FB's dist, Andy's dist for glow, and my dist for
   glow).
Other 'Across the board' changes:
5) Many of the libs/programs had more complete documentation as a comment in
   the FB5.61 version of them.  I've included this documentation.  In addition,
   I've set the @desc of the libraries to tell you what lines to list to see
   that documentation.
6) I've adjusted the scripts so that at the beginning and end there is a 'say'
   that tells you it's beginning or ending the installation, and what it's
   installing.  I have had problems in the past with seeing when the 
   installation is done, or if that 'pause' is just a some big huge lag. 

Programs originally written for glow MUF 1.9.3 or earlier, MUF FB5.61 or
earlier, or the original TinyMuck (any version), may or may not work 'as is'
if you're this distribution of libs.  At a minimum, any program using a
'standard macro' will require a $include $lib/glowstandard line towards the
beginning of the program. (I generally try to put the line with any other
$includes...). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cmd-register:
  I had to reincorporate the support for _version and _lib-version. Apparently,
  at some point it was removed from cmd-register.  Replaced calls to macros
  .strcheck, .noguest/guest? and sls/sts with the actual muf code they
  contained.  cmd-register is a special case, in that it can't make calls to
  libraries in it's definition, since it's installed before any libraries
  exist.  Bear this in mind when you decide to change library functions such
  as .tell changes to any library functions will NOT affect cmd-register.

lib-glow-standard:
  This file is new in this release.  It includes the macros contained in
  macro-macro, std-defs, def-pmatch, lib-props.  Be warned that almost all of
  the functions are prefixed by a period (e.g. .tell) prevent any potential
  conflicts with local words/functions.  The only exceptions are: for, endfor,
  xor.

lib-stackrng:
  Removed the redundant popoffn function (it was indentical in function as the
  inserver 'popn'.  Made sure that sr-deleterng and sr-poprng functions were
  changed appropiately.

cmd-mv-cp:
  Oops.  It was registering as cmd/mv-cp, but the lib defs props
  that were being set were using $global/mv-cp.  Minor bug there.
  I changed it so it is being registered as lib/mv-cp and cmd/mv-cp,
  changed lib defs to use $lib/mv-cp.

macro-macro:
  This file no longer exists.  All the macros from it have been moved to
  the $lib/glowstandard (lib-glow-standard).

macro-showlist:
  This file was converted to be used as $lib/showlist, and the file-name
  change to lib-showlist.  reg_names and file names should reflect function!

cmd-archive:
  Added the fb feature =p.  Fixed a bug where @archiv'ing #0 resulted in a error.

cmd-ic-ooc:
  New in this release.  A quick and dirty for setting the in_character flag for
  players.  defaults to ic=in character, ooc=out of character.

cmd-page:
  For 'idle status' it now uses the "idletime" sysparm instead of an arbitrary
  value and the help screens are cleaned up. (Thank you, Maddax).

con-caller:
  Commented out the ~accept checking, this is only used on Legacy.

cmd-ic-ooc:
  New in this distribution.  Sets/unsets the in_character flag. (with fancy message)

lock-guest:
  Removed.  Not needed for glow, make sure your guests are set G, and set the
exits you don't want guests to use G.

lock-prop:
  Removed. Use @lock obj=prop:val instead.  It checks the player, and/or any
objs in the player's possession.
